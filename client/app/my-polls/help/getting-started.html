  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>MARS is an audience response system that allows you to run different types of polls. People in the audience respond to polls using their phones. You can view the results in real time to get immediate feedback, or later for more detailed analysis. Getting started is easy:</p>
  <h3><span class="title-number">1.</span>Create a Collection</h3>
  <img class="md-whiteframe-1dp" src="./assets/img/create-collection.gif"/>
  <h3><span class="title-number">2.</span>Create a Group</h3>
  <img class="md-whiteframe-1dp" src="./assets/img/create-group.gif"/>
  <h3><span class="title-number">3.</span>Create a Poll</h3>
  <img class="md-whiteframe-1dp" src="./assets/img/create-poll.gif"/>
  <h3>Ready to Go!</h3>
  <p>That's all there is to it. Your poll is now ready to run. To learn more about what MARS can do, check out <a ui-sref="myPolls.help.default">Help and Support</a>.</p>
